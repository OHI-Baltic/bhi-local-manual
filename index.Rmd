# Welcome

Hi! <br>  
This manual is the Toolbox Manual for the Baltic Health Index (BHI). 
It takes inspiration from the [Ocean Health Index Toolbox Training](http://ohi-science.org/toolbox-training/) and it is adapted according to the unique features of the Baltic Sea.

The aim of this manual is to help you get “on board” with [Ocean Health Index (OHI)](http://ohi-science.org) methods and practices as you lead your own independent OHI assessment (OHI^+^) in the Baltic Sea. 

The OHI process has 4 steps: **Learn**, **Plan**, **Conduct**, and **Inform**. These steps are overlapping and iterative: as you plan your assessment you will continue to learn, as you conduct your assessment you will need to modify your plan and keep team members and stakeholders informed.
