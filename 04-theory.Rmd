The OHI framework categorizes **goals** and **sub-goals** representing ocean-derived benefits to people. <br>

When creating the framework, scientists, economists, and sociologists review existing studies of what people want and expect from the ocean and then group them these categories called ‘goals.’

Each goal is scored on the delivery of specific benefits with respect to a sustainable target. A goal is given a score of 100 if its benefits are maximized without compromising the ocean’s ability to deliver those benefits in the future. Lower scores indicate that more benefits could be gained or that current methods are harming the delivery of future benefits.

## Dimensions of the Index {-}

Goal Scores are based on several components: current status, likely future status, trend, pressures, and resilience.

To calculate each Goal Score we average the **Present Status** and **Likely Future Status**:

- **PRESENT STATUS** is a goal’s current value compared to its reference point, resulting in a score from 0 to 100.

- **LIKELY FUTURE STATUS** is the predicted status score five years into the future (once again, on a scale from 0 to 100), which is estimated by adjusting the current status score by 3 variables:

    - **TREND** indicates how fast the system is moving in a given direction, like velocity (rate of change)
    - **PRESSURES** which are the ecological and social factors that decrease a goal’s status.
    - **RESILIENCE** which are ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, etc.) that mitigate the pressures acting on a goal.

## Glossary {-}

- **Region’s Index Score**: the average of its goal scores. Goal scores are weighted equally in regional and global assessments, but independent assessments could weight them differently depending on local conditions and values.
